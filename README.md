## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS ( Grid & Flexbox )

I wanted to freshen up and practice flexbox and css grid so I decided to make a mock up of a site and utilize both.

## Lessons Learned:

I was reminded what amazing tools we have at our disposal now for layouts and responsivess compared to the suffering that was floats. CSS and Flexbox, I am grateful for you.
